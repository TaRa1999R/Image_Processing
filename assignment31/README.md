## Thirs part : Edge Detection
In this assignment we use two different edge detection method to find the following pictures edge :
![Alt text](inputs/input_3_lion.png)
![Alt text](inputs/input_3_spider.webp)

for the lion picture we used 'Sobel Operator', and the output is :
![Alt text](outputs/output_3_lion.jpg)

for the spider picture we used 'Laplacian Operator', and the result is:

## Fourth part : Vertical and Horizental Edge Detecion
In this assignment we use two different filter on a same picture, which you can see below :
![Alt text](inputs/input_4_bilding.png)

one of the filters is a horizental edge detection. It bolds horizental edges in the picture and it will give us the following output:
![Alt text](outputs/output_4_horizental.jpg)

the other filter is a vertical edge dection. It bolds vertical edges in the picture and it will give us the following output:
![Alt text](outputs/output_4_vertical.jpg)
